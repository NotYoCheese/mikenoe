    My journey has taken me from hands-on coding to strategic technology management,
     where I've led teams in developing cutting-edge solutions for companies 
     ranging from startups to Fortune 500 corporations. With a strong foundation
      in computer science and a passion for emerging technologies, I specialize 
      in architecting scalable systems, implementing agile methodologies, and 
      fostering a culture of continuous improvement. My expertise spans cloud 
      computing, and AI/ML integration, enabling me to navigate 
      the complex landscape of modern tech challenges while delivering tangible 
      business value.
