As an AI developer who often uses public data sets for various purposes, I find this terrifying:

A mobile app developer accidentally discovered child sexual abuse material in an AI training dataset and responsibly reported it to child safety organizations, only to have Google suspend his accounts as a result. The [incident](https://www.404media.co/a-developer-accidentally-found-csam-in-ai-data-google-banned-him-for-it/) highlights a troubling gap in how platforms handle users who are trying to do the right thing when encountering illegal content in widely-distributed AI datasets.
